# Runs this test program to check if gfx-hal is working:
#
#   ../libnov/cmd/load-image
#
# It defaults to the vulkan backend, but you can change it
# to any one of these others instead if you prefer and it's
# supported by your OS:
#
#   gl, dx12, dx11, metal, empty
#
# This is how you change it to OpenGL for example:
#
#   ./load-image.sh --features gl
#

pwd="$PWD"
cd nov

./load-image-metal.sh $@

cd "$pwd"
